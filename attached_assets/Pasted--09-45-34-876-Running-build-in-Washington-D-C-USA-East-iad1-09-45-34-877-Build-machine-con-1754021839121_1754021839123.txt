[09:45:50.753] (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
[09:45:50.753] - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
[09:45:50.753] - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
[09:45:50.753] - Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.[39m
